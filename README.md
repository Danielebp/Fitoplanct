# Fitoplanct

This is part of a project for Fitoplanct classification on the coast of the State of Rio de Janeiro - Brazil.
This part of the project uses the DTW algorithm to compute the difference between sensor readings of different species of fitoplancts. It also performs optimizations on the algorithm and allows it to run in some levels of parallelism.
